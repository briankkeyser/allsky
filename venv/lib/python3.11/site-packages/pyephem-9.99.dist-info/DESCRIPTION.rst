This distribution is a stub
that doesn’t install any Python packages,
but does list ``ephem`` as an install requirement
in case any old projects depend on this ``pyephem`` package name.
New projects are encouraged to directly require the main package,
which can be found at:

`https://pypi.org/project/ephem/ <https://pypi.org/project/ephem/>`_

This package’s version 9.99 is merely a placeholder value.
This package does not pin any particular PyEphem version,
but simply installs the latest version of the library.
Switch your project to depending on ``ephem`` directly
if you want to be able to pin a specific version.
